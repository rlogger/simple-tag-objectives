# opponent-modeling

Objective-typed multi-agent reinforcement learning plus a compact,
uncertainty-aware opponent-modeling pipeline. The repository includes:

- capture, risk-averse, and curious predator objectives;
- MAPPO specialist training and capture-aware rollouts;
- variable-length GRU-JEPA, fixed-window JEPA, beta-VAE, random, and supervised
  controls;
- online Bayesian strategy beliefs and belief-mixture action prediction;
- causal latent-conditioned behavior cloning; and
- validated replay, counterfactual, and CPL foundations for a future planner.

The code is runnable, but the repository contains no full checkpoints or
scientific result artifacts. See [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) for the exact
implementation and evidence boundary.

## Install

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 and the checked-in lockfile:

```bash
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=venv
uv sync --locked --all-extras
```

The lock pins the tested JaxMARL/JAX/Distrax combination; no separate JaxMARL
checkout is required. The explicit non-hidden environment path also keeps
editable package imports reliable on macOS. Keep `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`
exported while running the repository commands below.

## Verify the repository

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q
```

Run the deterministic end-to-end infrastructure smoke without checkpoints:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_part1.py \
  --synthetic \
  --n-eps 3 \
  --ckpt-seeds 0,1 \
  --encoder-seeds 0 \
  --bc-seeds 0 \
  --ctx 2 \
  --prefixes 2,4 \
  --hid 8 \
  --encoder-steps 1 \
  --bc-steps 1 \
  --out artifacts/part1_synthetic.json
```

This writes a schema-v2 smoke manifest. It tests plumbing only and is not an
experiment result.

## Train MAPPO specialists

```bash
uv run python scripts/train_mappo.py alg=mappo_objectives_capture NUM_SEEDS=3
uv run python scripts/train_mappo.py alg=mappo_objectives_risk NUM_SEEDS=3
uv run python scripts/train_mappo.py alg=mappo_objectives_curious NUM_SEEDS=3
```

Actor checkpoints are written under `logs/MPE_simple_tag_v3/`. Validate the
expected three-seed checkpoint set before a real pipeline run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_part1.py \
  --dry-run-checks \
  --prey-objective capture \
  --out artifacts/part1_dry.json
```

The reference protocol holds out whole checkpoint seeds and uses one fixed prey
checkpoint family across all predator objectives. This prevents the strategy
label from merely identifying three separately co-trained prey policies.

## Run the real pipeline

Start with `--run-kind smoke` and small declared budgets. A full execution must
use a clean committed worktree, a fixed prey objective, fresh rollouts, a
checkpoint-held-out split, and at least three distinct checkpoint, encoder, and
BC seeds:

```bash
N_EPISODES=...
ENCODER_STEPS=...
BC_STEPS=...
uv run python scripts/run_part1.py \
  --run-kind full \
  --prey-objective capture \
  --n-eps "$N_EPISODES" \
  --encoder-steps "$ENCODER_STEPS" \
  --bc-steps "$BC_STEPS" \
  --dataset-cache artifacts/part1_rollouts.npz \
  --out artifacts/part1_full.json
```

The source documents do not settle the full budgets or scientific success
thresholds. Accordingly, a successful full execution is recorded as
`full_run_finished`, not as proof of strategy recovery or robustness.
